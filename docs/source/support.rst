Where to ask for help
---------------------

Dask conversation happens in the following places:

1.  `StackOverflow #dask tag`_: for usage questions
2.  `Github Issue Tracker`_: for discussions around new features or established bugs
3.  `Gitter chat`_: for real-time discussion

For usage questions and bug reports we strongly prefer the use of StackOverflow
and Github issues respectively over gitter chat.  Github and StackOverflow are
more easily searchable by future users and so is more efficient for everyone's
time.  Gitter chat is generally reserved for community discussion.
